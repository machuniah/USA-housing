USA Housing Data Analysis 

Introduction

This project takes a deep dive into the data to uncover trends . We’ll explore factors like home size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and even crime rates to see how they influence property values. Using data visualization, we turned raw numbers into meaningful insights.

 What our project entails

House Price Trends  – See how home prices vary across different properties.

Feature Relationships – Identify which factors play the biggest role in pricing.

Scatter Plots  – Discover connections between square footage, crime rate, and price.

Box Plot Analysis – Compare house prices across different bedroom counts.

Pair Plots  – Explore how multiple features interact at a glance.
