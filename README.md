# USA Housing Data Analysis 

## Introduction

This project takes a deep dive into the data to uncover trends . We’ll explore factors like home size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and even crime rates to see how they influence property values. Using data visualization, we turned raw numbers into meaningful insights.

## What our project entails

- **House Price Trends** – See how home prices vary across different properties.

- **Feature Relationships** – Identify which factors play the biggest role in pricing.

- **Scatter Plots**  – Discover connections between square footage, crime rate, and price.

- **Box Plot Analysis** – Compare house prices across different bedroom counts.

- **Pair Plots and Heatmaps**  – Explore how multiple features interact at a glance.

### Data Visualization
 We performed several visual analyses to gain insights into housing prices:
- **House Price Distribution:** A histogram to show how prices are distributed.
- **Feature Correlation Heatmap:** Identifies how different factors correlate with house prices.
- **Scatter Plots:**
  - **Square Feet vs. Price:** Larger homes tend to have higher prices.
  - **Crime Rate vs. Price:** Higher crime rates are associated with lower house prices.
  - **Year Built vs. Price:** Examined the impact of house age on price.
- **Box Plot Analysis:** Compared house prices based on the number of bedrooms.

## About the Data

- **Dataset:** usa_housing_kaggle.csv

- **Key Features:**

 | Feature      | Description |
  |-------------|-------------|
  | **SquareFeet** | The size of the house (in sq ft) |

  | **Bathrooms** | Number of bathrooms |
  | **CrimeRate** | Crime rate in the neighborhood |
  | **YearBuilt** | The year the house was built |
  | **Price**     | Selling price of the house |

## Tools Used

Python  – The foundation of the analysis.

Pandas – For organizing and processing data.

Seaborn & Matplotlib – To create clear and informative visuals.

Jupyter Notebook – For interactive data exploration.
