# USA Housing Data Analysis 

## Introduction

This project takes a deep dive into the data to uncover trends . We’ll explore factors like home size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and even crime rates to see how they influence property values. Using data visualization, we turned raw numbers into meaningful insights.

## What our project entails

- House Price Trends  – See how home prices vary across different properties.

- Feature Relationships – Identify which factors play the biggest role in pricing.

- Scatter Plots  – Discover connections between square footage, crime rate, and price.

- Box Plot Analysis – Compare house prices across different bedroom counts.

- Pair Plots  – Explore how multiple features interact at a glance.

## About the Data

- Dataset: usa_housing_kaggle.csv

- Key Features:

 * SquareFeet – The size of the house.

 * Bedrooms – How many bedrooms the home has.

 * Bathrooms – Number of bathrooms.

 * CrimeRate – The crime rate in the neighborhood.

 * Price – The selling price of the house.

## Tools Used

Python  – The foundation of the analysis.

Pandas – For organizing and processing data.

Seaborn & Matplotlib – To create clear and informative visuals.

Jupyter Notebook – For interactive data exploration.
